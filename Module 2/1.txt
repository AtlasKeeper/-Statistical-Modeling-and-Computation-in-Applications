Dimension reduction refers to a set of techniques which can transform high-dimensional data into their representative low-dimensional data. During the process, some information of the original data is discarded but some main characteristics of the original data is preserved.

Dimension reduction is important because processing and analyzing high-dimensional data can be computationally intractable. Dimension reduction is very useful in dealing with a large number of observations and variables, hence it is widely used in many fields such as signal processing, machine learning, and bioinformatics.

Three dimension reduction techniques will be introduced:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), and

Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE).

PCA tries to project the original high-dimensional data into lower dimensions by capturing the most prominent variance in the data.

MDS is a technique for reducing data dimensions while attempting to preserve the relative distance between high-dimensional data points.

SNE is a non-linear technique to â€œcluster" data points by trying to keep similar data points close to each other.

PCA and classical MDS share similar computations: they both use the spectral decomposition of symmetric matrices, but on different input matrices.
